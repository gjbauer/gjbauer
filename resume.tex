\section*{Technical Projects}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{B+Tree File System with FUSE Driver} \hfill \textit{C, FUSE, Multithreading} \\
    - Designed and implemented a user-space file system using a balanced B+Tree for efficient file indexing and retrieval \\
    - Integrated a custom block cache to reduce I/O latency, improving read/write performance by approximately 20\% in benchmark tests \\
    - Ensured thread-safe operations by implementing concurrency controls, allowing simultaneous file access
    
    \item \textbf{Multithreaded Web Server in Rust} \hfill \textit{Rust, HTTP, TCP} \\
    - Built a functional web server from scratch capable of handling multiple concurrent connections using a thread pool \\
    - Parsed HTTP requests and delivered appropriate responses, solidifying understanding of network protocols and Rust's ownership model \\
    - Improved server resilience by implementing graceful shutdown procedures
    
    \item \textbf{Persistent RAM Game State Handler} \hfill \textit{C, Embedded Systems} \\
    - Programmed a Texas Instruments development board to save and restore the state of a Tetris/Breakout hybrid game using persistent RAM \\
    - Engineered a solution to write game data to non-volatile memory, allowing the game to resume seamlessly after a complete power cycle
